# smtpd.conf for the maurus.networks email config


### set up the selected certificates
pki {{receiver_hostname}} cert "{{receiver_certfile|trim}}"
pki {{receiver_hostname}} key "{{receiver_keyfile|trim}}"
pki {{relay_hostname}} cert "{{relay_certfile|trim}}"
pki {{relay_hostname}} key "{{relay_keyfile|trim}}"

### define our filters
# upstream has removed the current filter implementations, so we carefully only use filters
# that we know to work.
#filter greylistd greylistd
#filter dnsbl dnsbl "-h" "ix.dnsbl.manitu.net"
#filter f_incoming chain greylistd # dnsbl


### load valid domains and users which we accept mail for from PostgreSQL
table validdomains postgres:/etc/smtpd/postgresql.table.conf
table validrecipients postgres:/etc/smtpd/postgresql.table.conf
table credentials postgres:/etc/smtpd/postgresql.table.conf


### receive email from the internet (i.e. unauthenticated users) who may or may not use TLS
listen on "{{receiver_ip}}" port 25 tls pki "{{receiver_hostname}}" \
    hostname "{{receiver_hostname}}" tag UNFILTERED #filter f_incoming
listen on "{{receiver_ip}}" port 465 smtps pki "{{receiver_hostname}}" \
    hostname "{{receiver_hostname}}" tag UNFILTERED #filter f_incoming

### incoming email for external authenticated users who must use TLS
listen on "{{relay_ip}}" port 25 tls-require auth <credentials> \
    pki "{{relay_hostname}}" hostname "{{relay_hostname}}" tag AUTHENTICATED
listen on "{{relay_ip}}" port 465 smtps auth <credentials> \
    pki "{{relay_hostname}}" hostname "{{relay_hostname}}" tag AUTHENTICATED

### incoming email for internal applications
listen on "{{internal_relay_ip}}" port 25 tls pki \
    "{{internal_relay_hostname}}" hostname "{{internal_relay_hostname}}" \
    tag INTERNAL


### Reject anything on an invalid domain.
match tag UNFILTERED from any ! for domain <validdomains> reject


### email with a valid recipient, but tagged as UNFILTERED now goes to
### amavisd-new on port 10026 and comes back on port 10025
action amavisd relay host "lmtp://localhost:10026"
match tag UNFILTERED from any for domain <validdomains> \
    rcpt-to <validrecipients> action amavisd
listen on localhost port 10025 tag FILTERED


### relay mail for authenticated users either here or remotely after DKIM signing it
action mailforwarder relay host "smtp://localhost:10046"
action dkimsign relay host "smtp://localhost:10036"
match tag AUTHENTICATED from any \
    for domain <validdomains> rcpt-to <validrecipients> \
    action mailforwarder
match tag AUTHENTICATED from any for any action dkimsign


### deliver internal network mail. This is submitted through Smartstack by other
### daemons in the network.
match tag INTERNAL from any for any action dkimsign


### email that went through amavisd goes to mailforwarder for
### mailing list/alias processing. When it comes back, aliases have been
### removed from the RCPT TO list. Everything tagged FILTERED has already
### validated recipients.
match tag FILTERED from local for any action mailforwarder
listen on localhost port 10045 tag FINISHED


### the mailforwarder might send emails to external addresses. Then they must be
### DKIM signed at which point the SIGNED rule will process them above.
### `for any recipient` will not deny invalid addresses to the rule below will only
### match non-local accounts and follow through to the delivery rule below.
### This basically accepts *all* mail. So this is only okay because it's on localhost.
match tag FINISHED from local \
    for any ! rcpt-to <validrecipients> action dkimsign


### deliver remote incoming mail that has been filtered by amavisd and processed
### by the mailforwarder daemon
action deliver_into_maildir mda \
    "/usr/lib/dovecot/dovecot-lda -f %{sender} -d %{rcpt}" user virtmail
match tag FINISHED from local \
    for domain <validdomains> rcpt-to <validrecipients> action deliver_into_maildir


### mail coming back from DKIM signing, goes out to the world
listen on localhost port 10035 tag SIGNED
action send relay
match tag SIGNED from local for any action send


### allow the mail node itself to relay mail via sendmail
match from local for any action mailforwarder

### if none of the above rules match, the default behavior is to reject, which is fine.
### EOF
