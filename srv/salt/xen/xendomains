# The xendomains script can send SysRq requests to domains on shutdown.
# If you don't want to MIGRATE, SAVE, or SHUTDOWN, this may be a possibility
# to do a quick and dirty shutdown ("s e i u o") or at least sync the disks
# of the domains ("s").
#
# see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
XENDOMAINS_SYSRQ=s e i u o

# Set this to a non-empty string if you want to migrate virtual machines
# on shutdown. The string will be passed to the xm migrate DOMID command
# as is: It should contain the target IP address of the physical machine
# to migrate to and optionally parameters like --live. Leave empty if
# you don't want to try virtual machine relocation on shutdown.
# If migration succeeds, neither SAVE nor SHUTDOWN will be executed for
# that domain.
#
# XENDOMAINS_MIGRATE=

# Directory to save running domains to when the system (dom0) is
# shut down. Will also be used to restore domains from if # XENDOMAINS_RESTORE
# is set (see below). Leave empty to disable domain saving on shutdown
# (e.g. because you rather shut domains down).
# If domain saving does succeed, SHUTDOWN will not be executed.
#
# Don't save domains because most domains require encrypted disks to be mounted
XENDOMAINS_SAVE=

# This variable determines whether saved domains from XENDOMAINS_SAVE
# will be restored on system startup.
#
# Don't save domains because most domains require encrypted disks to be mounted
XENDOMAINS_RESTORE=false

# This variable sets the directory where domains configurations
# are stored that should be started on system startup automatically.
# Leave empty if you don't want to start domains automatically
# (or just don't place any xen domain config files in that dir).
# Note that the script tries to be clever if both RESTORE and AUTO are
# set: It will first restore saved domains and then only start domains
# in AUTO which are not running yet.
# Note that the name matching is somewhat fuzzy.
#
XENDOMAINS_AUTO=/etc/xen/auto

# On xendomains stop, a number of xm commands (xm migrate, save, shutdown,
# shutdown --all) may be executed. In the worst case, these commands may
# stall forever, which will prevent a successful shutdown of the machine.
# If this variable is non-zero, the script will set up a watchdog timer
# for every of these xm commands and time it out after the number of seconds
# specified by this variable.
# Note that SHUTDOWN_ALL will not be called if no virtual machines or only
# zombies are still running, so you don't need to enable this timeout just
# for the zombie case.
# The setting should be large enough to make sure that migrate/save/shutdown
# can succeed. If you do live migrations, keep in mind that live migration
# of a 1GB machine over Gigabit ethernet may actually take something like
# 100s (assuming that live migration uses 10% of the network # bandwidth).
# Depending on the virtual machine, a shutdown may also require a significant
# amount of time. So better setup this variable to a huge number and hope the
# watchdog never fires.
