# * Logging and Replication

# * InnoDB
#
# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!

# * Security Features

# Read the manual, too, if you want chroot!

# For generating SSL certificates I recommend the OpenSSL GUI "tinyca".

# This will be passed to all mysql clients
# It has been reported that passwords should be enclosed with ticks/quotes
# escpecially if they contain "#" chars...
# Remember to edit /etc/mysql/debian.cnf when changing the socket location.
