# the vault executable must have the "cap_ipc_lock=+ep" flag so it can lock memory from swap.
# Regardless, ideally Vault runs on a server with encrypted swap space. However even if it doesn't then locking the
# memory will provide additional security. For more information see `man setcap` and `man cap_from_text`, the latter
# is part of "libcap-dev" on Debian.
