#
# Installs Hashicorp Vault in /usr/local/bin from a binary distribution downloaded from the internet.
# The service is published via consul and also stores data in the local consul cluster discovered via the
# saltmine (see consul.install for details on the local consul cluster which must exist if you're using this
# saltshaker). Applications can then use Vault nodes to get credentials like SSL certificates, AWS access
# credentials and more.
